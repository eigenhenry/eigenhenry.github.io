It is known that self-esteem helps solve problems. From the algorithmic viewpoint, this seems like a mystery: a boost in self-esteem does not provide us with new algorithms, does not provide us with ability to compute fasterâ€”but somehow, with the same algorithmic tools and the same ability to perform the corresponding computations, students become better problem solvers. In this paper, we provide an algorithmic explanation for this surprising empirical phenomenon.
