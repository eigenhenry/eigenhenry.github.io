This work-in-progress research paper shares preliminary results from exploring faculty perceptions and beliefs about students' backgrounds in engineering at Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Faculty enhance or hinder learning through their interactions with students. Fostering an asset or supportive-based mindset in the classroom is crucial to supporting students' learning. As part of a larger multiple case study, preliminary results from a qualitative analysis of faculty interviews indicate that most faculty fostered a supportive-based mindset (e.g., intentional approaches to help students or alleviate challenges), an emergent theme regarding students' backgrounds, while others gravitated towards asset-based perspectives. Despite these findings, a few faculty members also expressed deficit-based mindsets. Therefore, this study seeks to enable the design of faculty development opportunities at HSIs informed by understanding faculty perspectives of their students' backgrounds.
