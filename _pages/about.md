I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and graduate researcher at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), with Master's degrees in both Computational Science and Engineering. I consider myself a mixed-methods researcher, specifically focusing on triangulating between qualitative and quantitative approaches.

## Research Focus
My primary research explores Causality as a theoretical framework for understanding relationships between variables and isolating their direct and indirect effects. As AI/ML systems become more prevalent across disciplines, I investigate how these models—which often achieve high accuracy by identifying correlations—can better capture true causal relationships.

Given the "black box" nature of many modern architectures, I am particularly interested in AI explainability and verifying whether the features prioritized by models align with domain expert knowledge. I am also passionate about engineering education and developing effective support systems for both students and faculty.

## Research Teams
I actively contribute to two research teams:

* The AMPLIFY Project: Understanding and amplifying faculty experience in their education change process. 
* CR2G: Exploring computing topics including neural networks, decision-making under uncertainty, optimization, and computer arithmetic


## Dissertation Committee
- Dr. Meagan R. Kendall and Dr. Martine Ceberio (UTEP, Co-Chairs)
- Dr. Alexandra Coso Strong (Cornell)
