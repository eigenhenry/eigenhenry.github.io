Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and a graduate researcher at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), where I've already completed two Master's degrees in Computational Science and Engineering Education.

## Research Focus
I’m a researcher working at the intersection of computer science, data science, and education. I’m especially drawn to mixed-methods research, where combining different types of data can reveal richer insights. I have experience in qualitative methods (e.g., case studies, narrative analysis) and quantitative methods (eg, regression models, machine learning models ). More broadly, I’m interested in how causality can strengthen AI explainability (XAI). 

## Research Teams
I actively contribute to two research teams:

* **The AMPLIFY Project** – Focused on understanding and amplifying faculty experience in their education change process.  
* **CR2G** – Exploring computing topics including neural networks, decision-making under uncertainty, optimization, and computer arithmetic.

## Dissertation Committee
* [Dr. Meagan R. Kendall](https://www.utep.edu/engineering/amplify/team/) and [Dr. Martine Ceberio](https://martineceberio.fr/), UTEP, Co-Chairs  
* [Dr. Alexandra Coso Strong (Cornell)](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/alexandra-coso-strong/)

I welcome collaboration opportunities! If you share similar interests or have project ideas, please reach out.
