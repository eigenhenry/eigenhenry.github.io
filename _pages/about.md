Hello! My name is Henry. I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). I completed all my education at UTEP, including two Master's degrees: one in Computational Science and another in Engineering with a major in CS and a minor in engineering education.

## Research Focus
I'm a researcher working at the intersection of computer science, data science, and education. I consider myself a mixed-methods researcher with experience in both qualitative methods (e.g., inductive & deductive coding, narrative analysis) and quantitative methods (e.g., traditional statistical models, machine learning models). Recently, I've developed a growing interest in causal inference and AI explainability (XAI) methods.

## Research Teams
I actively contribute to two research teams:
 
* **CR2G** – Lab focused on exploring a variety of computing topics, including neural networks, decision-making under uncertainty, optimization, and computer arithmetic.
* **The AMPLIFY Project** – Focused on understanding and amplifying STEM faculty experiences in their education change process at Hispanic Serving Institutions 

## Dissertation Committee
* [Dr. Meagan R. Kendall](https://www.utep.edu/engineering/amplify/team/) (UTEP, Chair)
* [Dr. Martine Ceberio](https://martineceberio.fr/)  (UTEP, Co-chair)
