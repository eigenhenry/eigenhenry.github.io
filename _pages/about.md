Hello! My name is Henry. I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). I completed all my education at UTEP, including two Master's degrees: one in Computational Science and another in Engineering.
## Research Interests
I'm a research scientist working at the intersection of computer science, data science, and engineering education. I enjoy using mixed-methods and have experience in both qualitative methods (e.g., thematic analysis, narrative analysis) and quantitative methods (e.g., traditional statistical models, deep learning models). Recently, I've developed a growing interest in causal inference and AI explainability (XAI) methods. 

## Research Teams
I actively contribute to two research teams:
 
* [**CR2G**](http://cr2g.constraintsolving.com/) – Lab with diverse interests in computing topics, including: explainability, neural networks, decision-making under uncertainty, optimization, and computer arithmetic.
* [**The AMPLIFY Project**](https://www.utep.edu/engineering/amplify/) – NSF project focused on understanding and amplifying STEM faculty experiences in their education change process at Hispanic Serving Institutions. 

## Dissertation Committee
* [Dr. Meagan R. Kendall](https://expertise.utep.edu/profiles/mvaughan) (UTEP, Chair)
* [Dr. Martine Ceberio](https://martineceberio.fr/)  (UTEP, Chair)  
* [Dr. Alexandra Coso Strong](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/alexandra-coso-strong/) (Cornell University)
* [Dr. Saeid Tizpaz-Niari](https://tizpaz.github.io/) (University of Illinois Chicago)
* [Dr. Christoph Lauter](https://www.christoph-lauter.org/) (UTEP)

I welcome collaboration opportunities! If you share similar interests or have project ideas, please reach out.
