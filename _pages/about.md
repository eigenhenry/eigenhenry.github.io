Hello! My name is Henry Salgado, and I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and a graduate researcher at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). I hold two Master’s degrees—one in Computational Science and the other in Engineering.

My research focuses on faculty experiences in higher education, particularly exploring workplace environments, support systems, and satisfaction using linear causal modeling. Additionally, I am interested in causal machine learning and explainable AI, aiming to understand how AI/ML models make decisions beyond traditional accuracy metrics. As AI continues to excel in classification and prediction, determining which features (or sets of features) drive model decisions remains a key challenge. My work seeks to bridge this gap using causality as a framework for explainability.

I am always open to collaboration! If you are interested in similar topics or have a project in mind, feel free to reach out.
