**Henry Salgado**

**Education & Research**
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and graduate researcher at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), with Master's degrees in both Computational Science and Engineering.

**Research Focus**
My primary research focuses on Causality as a theoretical framework for understanding relationships between variables and isolating their direct and indirect effects. As AI/ML systems become increasingly prevalent across disciplines, I investigate how these models—which often achieve high accuracy by identifying correlations—can better capture true causal relationships. Given the "black box" nature of many modern architectures, I am particularly interested in AI explainability and verifying whether the features prioritized by models align with domain expert knowledge.

**Research Teams**

I actively contribute to two research teams:

The AMPLIFY Project: Supporting faculty in implementing meaningful educational change
CR2G: Exploring computing topics including neural networks, decision-making under uncertainty, optimization, and computer arithmetic

I am also passionate about engineering education and developing support systems for both students and faculty.

**Dissertation Committee**

Dr. Meagan R. Kendall and Dr. Martine Ceberio (UTEP, Co-Chairs)
Dr. Alexandra Coso Strong (Cornell)

I welcome collaboration opportunities! If you share similar interests or have project ideas, please reach out.
