About Me
======
I am currently a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science and a graduate researcher at The University of Texas at El Paso, where I have completed two Master's degrees: one in Computational Science and another in Engineering. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer science, data science, and engineering education. 

I am part of the AMPLIFY Research Project, under the guidance of  Dr.  Meagan R. Kendall (UTEP) and Dr.  Alexadra Coso-Strong (Cornell). 

Current Research Interests
