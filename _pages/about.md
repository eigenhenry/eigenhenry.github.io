My research focuses on faculty experiences in higher education, particularly exploring workplace environments, support systems, and satisfaction using linear causal modeling. Additionally, I am interested in causal machine learning and explainable AI, aiming to understand how AI/ML models make decisions beyond traditional accuracy metrics. As AI continues to excel in classification and prediction, determining which features (or sets of features) drive model decisions remains a key challenge. My work seeks to bridge this gap using causality as a framework for explainability.

I am always open to collaboration! If you are interested in similar topics or have a project in mind, feel free to reach out.
