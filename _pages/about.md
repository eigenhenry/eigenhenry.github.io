Hello! My name is Henry Salgado, and I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and a graduate researcher at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). I hold two Master's degreesâ€”one in Computational Science and the other in Engineering.

My research interests span both Engineering Education (e.g., experiences of students and faculty in STEM fields) and Computer Science (Explainable AI). I am particularly drawn to Causality as a framework for understanding not only associations between variables but also isolating and estimating their direct and indirect effects.

In application, I study faculty experiences in higher education, particularly exploring workplace environments, support systems, and satisfaction using linear causal modeling. Additionally, I am interested in causal machine learning and explainable AI, aiming to understand how AI/ML models make decisions beyond traditional accuracy metrics. As AI continues to excel in classification and prediction, determining which features (or sets of features) drive model decisions remains a key challenge. My work seeks to bridge this gap using causality as a framework for explainability.

I am always open to collaboration! If you are interested in similar topics or have a project in mind, feel free to reach out.
