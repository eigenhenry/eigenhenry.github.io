Hello! My name is Henry. I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). I completed all my education at UTEP, including two Master's degrees: one in Computational Science and another in Engineering with a major in CS and a minor in engineering education.

## Research Focus
I’m a researcher working at the intersection of computer science, data science, and education. I consider myself a mixed-methods researcher. I have experience in qualitative methods (e.g., inductive & deductive coding, narrative analysis) and quantitative methods (e.g., statistical models, machine learning models). More broadly, I’m interested in causality and AI explainability (XAI) methods. 

## Research Teams
I actively contribute to two research teams:
 
* **CR2G** – Lab focused on exploring a variety of computing topics, including neural networks, decision-making under uncertainty, optimization, and computer arithmetic.
* **The AMPLIFY Project** – Focused on understanding and amplifying faculty experiences in their education change process. 

## Dissertation Committee
* [Dr. Meagan R. Kendall](https://www.utep.edu/engineering/amplify/team/) and [Dr. Martine Ceberio](https://martineceberio.fr/)  (UTEP, Co-Chaired)  
* [Dr. Alexandra Coso Strong (Cornell University)](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/alexandra-coso-strong/)
* [Dr. Saeid Tizpaz-Niari (University of Illinois Chicago)](https://tizpaz.github.io/)
* [Dr. Christoph Lauter (UTEP)](https://www.christoph-lauter.org/)

I welcome collaboration opportunities! If you share similar interests or have project ideas, please reach out.
